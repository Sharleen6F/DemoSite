Low structure courses have few opportunities for engagement and assessment whereas high structure courses embed multiple opportunities for engagement and frequent assessments (Beck &amp; Roosa, 2020). Low structure courses assume that students know how to efficiently work with course materials in and outside of class. However, data suggest that many students do not implement effective study strategies nor time management skills (Hartwig &amp; Dunlosky, 2012). High structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice and by decoding the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations (Beck &amp; Roosa, 2020).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs38.png" alt/></p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Examine the home pages for two courses, and identify which course is low structure and which one is high structure.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs39.png" alt/></p></div></div><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p><strong>Comparing Course Designs</strong></p><p>Examine the two course preparations below that describe one week of a course.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs40.png" alt/></p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs41.png" alt/></p><p>Which course looks more like yours and why?</p><p>If you haven&#39;t taught a course yet, which course preparation resonates with your experiences as a student?</p></div></div><h3 id="The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses">The Impact of High Structure Courses</a><a id="The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Increasing a course&#39;s structure has many implications for student learning and their educational experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Student failure rates</strong> were lower in a moderately structured course design and were <strong>dramatically lower in a highly structured course design</strong> (Freeman et al., 2011)</li><li>A &quot;moderate-structure&quot; intervention <strong>increased course performance for all student populations</strong>, but worked <strong>disproportionately well for black students and first-generation students</strong>. Students also consistently reported completing the assigned readings more frequently, spending more time studying for class, and feeling an increased sense of community (Eddy &amp; Hogan, 2014)</li><li>Implementing a hybrid course format with high structure improved exam performance for <strong>traditionally underrepresented students</strong> (Gavassa et al., 2019)</li><li>A highly structured course design improved the performance of all students in a college-level introductory biology class and <strong>reduced the achievement gap between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged students</strong> (Haak et al., 2011)</li></ul><h3 id="Show-Me-the-Data!"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Show-Me-the-Data!">Show Me the Data!</a><a id="Show-Me-the-Data!-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Show-Me-the-Data!" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Freeman and colleagues measured failure rates in a major&#39;s introductory biology course, while varying the structure of the course. One instructor taught the course in <span>$6$</span> iterations using a low structure, moderate structure, or high structure course design (2011). The researchers found that the difference between the proportion of students predicted to fail and the actual proportion failing decreased with increasing structure.

The <strong>conventional syllabus</strong> is <em>content-focused</em>, providing a brief overview of the course subject matter followed by a weekly outline of topics to be covered, and a list of assignments and course activities with relative grading weights and due dates.</p><p>A <strong>learner-centered syllabus</strong> also provides basic course information, but <strong>it shifts the emphasis</strong> from what the instructor will cover in the course <em>to what learning outcomes students will achieve by the end of the course</em> (Johnson, 2006). It explains how learning will be assessed and offers information and tools to promote student learning and intellectual development in an inclusive environment. It establishes the responsibilities of the instructor(s) and students for achieving course goals. In short, the learner-centered syllabus &quot;becomes an invitation to share responsibility for successful learning&quot; (O&#39;Brien et al., 2008, p. 22).</p><p>In his book, &quot;What the Best College Teachers Do,&quot; Ken Bain (2004) describes three parts of what he calls &quot;the promising syllabus&quot;:</p><ol><li><strong>Highlight the promises or opportunities.</strong><ul><li>What kinds of questions will the course help students answer?</li><li>What kind of intellectual, physical, emotional, or social abilities will it help them develop?</li><li>Why is the course relevant?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Explain what students will do to meet those promises.</strong><ul><li>What are the learning activities (e.g., activities, assignments, readings) that will be used in the course?</li><li>How will they learn from the course resources, the instructional team, and each other?</li><li>Give students a sense of agency in their education</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discuss how students will engage in the learning process.</strong><ul><li>How will the instructor and students best &quot;understand the nature and progress of their learning?&quot;</li><li>How will learning be evaluated?</li><li>How will all students feel included in the learning process and welcome as scientists?</li></ul></li></ol><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Learner-Centered Syllabus</h4><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click to see an example excerpt of a learner-centered syllabus</summary><div class="admonition-body"><p>The following is excerpted from Dr. Cara Gormally&#39;s asynchronous introductory biology class for non-majors (bilingual-American Sign Language &amp; English).</p><p><strong>What we&#39;ll actually do</strong></p><ul><li>You&#39;re likely taking this class because it&#39;s required for your major.</li><li>My goal: make this class actually useful to your life.</li><li>Together, we&#39;ll make this class meaningful for ourselves.

This work feels real and important to me. I hope you think so, too.</li></ul><p><strong>Diversity: it makes our class better</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build community through discussion:</strong> Though we won&#39;t meet face-to-face, we&#39;ll learn about each other and build a community through our discussions.</li><li><strong>Diversity strengthens us:</strong> The diversity that we all bring to this class is a resource, strength and benefit to our class. I&#39;m committed to anti-racism and I believe Black Lives Matter. Everyone belongs here in my classroom if you want to be here. In this class, we&#39;ll use materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, national origin, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.</li><li><strong>You make our class what it is.</strong> Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective–it&#39;s important.</li></ul></div></details><p>Now that you&#39;ve seen a learner-centered syllabus, reflect on your own syllabus. (If you do not have one, think about a traditional syllabus or one from a course you&#39;ve taken.) Think about the elements in a learner-centered syllabus and the components of your syllabus.</p><p>What are two things you could change in your syllabus to make it more learner-centered? You can use these prompts to help you re-imagine your syllabus:</p><ul><li>What are the promises or opportunities presented by the instructor?</li><li>What activities will students do in order to meet those promises?</li><li>How will students track progress of their learning (i.e., how will learning be evaluated)?</li></ul></div></div><!--
