    - Examine the parallels between your scientific research and your teaching approaches.
    - Commit to one action you could take to address each of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching in your course.
    - Understand key concepts and principles:
        - Good teaching embodies five dimensions of inclusion: students, instructors, curriculum, pedagogy, and the classroom climate.
        - These dimensions can work together to create a cohesive learning experience.
        - Instructors do not need to be educational experts to be good teachers, but it helps to use methods that are (1) based on solid theory, (2) tested and evaluated in the classroom, and (3) organized by a logical framework.

What should students know or be able to do after instruction? What are the desired results after the course or a lesson? Engaging in backward design intentionally integrates the curricula and pedagogy dimensions as we consider how to make our courses effective and inclusive for all students.</p><p>The process of backward design typically involves three stages:</p><ol><li>Establishing learning goals and objectives: What skills and knowledge should students learn?</li><li>Creating assessments that match those objectives: What evidence is needed to know if students have gained the skills and knowledge?</li><li>Designing learning experiences (instructional materials and activities) that will help students achieve those objectives: What activities will teach these skills and knowledge?</li></ol><p>Although backward design emphasizes starting with the end in mind, the process itself is not always strictly linear or sequential.</p><p>Educators may revisit stages of the backward design process multiple times to refine goals/objectives, assessments, and learning experiences. Additionally, backward design allows for flexibility in adjusting instructional strategies based on ongoing assessment of student needs and progress. This may result in revisions throughout the learning process, which may not adhere to a strictly &quot;backward&quot; order.</p><p>And importantly, this approach focuses on what students should be able to do as a result of their learning.</p><p>By prioritizing learning objectives, teachers are able to create more targeted and effective instruction that is better aligned with the needs of their students, rather than designing materials based on covering a certain amount of content.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Compare Two Courses</h4><p>Two professors are covering the same learning objective and using the same assessment in their introductory science courses.</p><ul><li>Objective: Using the scientific method, design an experiment based on a given hypothesis.</li><li>Assessment: Given the results of an experiment on antibiotic resistance, design a follow-up experiment that tests a revised hypothesis.</li></ul><p>They have both planned various activities to meet the learning objective:</p><figure>

The taxonomy consists of six levels, where each level builds upon the prior (McNulty, 2019):</p><ol><li><strong>Remember:</strong> Can the learner recall or retain the information? Action verbs: define, duplicate, identify, list, memorize, name, recall, recognize, repeat, state</li><li><strong>Comprehend:</strong> Can the learner explain ideas or concepts? Action verbs: classify, describe, discuss, explain, locate, paraphrase, report, select, summarize, translate</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> Can the learner use information in a new way? Action verbs: choose, demonstrate, dramatize, draw, employ, execute, illustrate, implement, interpret, operate, perform, sketch, solve, use</li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Can the learner distinguish between different parts? Action verbs: compare, contrast, deconstruct, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, infer, investigate, organize, predict, question, test</li><li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Can the learner justify a stand or decision? Action verbs: appraise, argue, assess, criticize, critique, defend, judge, justify, prioritize, support, value</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Can the learner create a new product or point of view? Action verbs: assemble, build, compose, construct, design, develop, devise, formulate, invent, plan, produce, write</li></ol><p>The framework is used to progressively move learners based on their prior knowledge and abilities from lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) to higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS).</p><p>Action verbs appropriate for each level can be chosen to communicate the cognitive level of the objective or assessment.</p><p>There are many other ways to characterize cognitive levels; we recommend Bloom&#39;s taxonomy because it is straightforward and easy to use.</p><p>However, since it can be difficult to distinguish between the 6 levels of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, we prefer to divide Bloom&#39;s by LOCS and HOCS.</p><p>In general, levels 1 and 2 are LOCS and levels 3-6 are HOCS. But depending on the context and what information the student is given, exercises written for higher Bloom&#39;s levels such as levels 3 (Apply) and 5 (Evaluate) can be considered LOCS. Often, the distinction depends on the novelty of the task. For example, if students do an evaluation activity in class (HOCS) and encounter the same exercise on an assessment, then it&#39;s no longer an evaluation, but a recall task (LOCS) that reinforces what was learned in class.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Practice Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy</h4><p>For each assessment prompt below, identify if targets a lower-order cognitive skill (LOCS) or higher-order cognitive skill (HOCS):</p><ol><li>Design an experiment to test one of Newton&#39;s laws of motion, including the necessary equipment, data collection methods, and analysis.</li><li>Use Figure 3 in the textbook to draw your own model that demonstrates one or more of Newton&#39;s laws of motion, including the necessary variables and assumptions.</li><li>Define Isaac Newton&#39;s three laws of motion, including examples of each.</li><li>Critique the validity of an experiment or study that uses Newton&#39;s laws of motion to explain a physical phenomenon, including its limitations and potential sources of error.</li><li>Explain the difference between mass and weight.</li><li>Considering the forces acting on an object in motion (direction and magnitude), predict the resultant motion of the object using Newton&#39;s laws.</li></ol></div></div><hr/><h2 id="Course-Design-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice">Course Design in Practice</a><a id="Course-Design-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p><code>NOTE: This content was restructured recently.

They describe the overall goal or purpose of an instructional unit, and do not have to be directly measurable with a single assessment. A learning goal can be focused on behavior, skills, or content, and should be linked to the even broader goals of a curriculum or program.</li><li><strong>Learning objectives</strong> are specific, action-oriented, and measurable statements that describe the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate as a result of their learning. Objectives are narrower and more focused than learning goals and are designed to be achievable within a particular time frame and level of instruction. Learning objectives are aligned to learning goals, and achievement of specific learning objectives should lead to progression towards a learning goal.</li></ul><p>One way to visualize the difference between the two is to think about learning goals as the destination on a map or GPS, while learning objectives are the individual steps or directions that must be followed to reach that destination.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Identify Goals and Objectives</h4><p>Which of the following statements are learning goals, and which are learning objectives?</p><ul><li>Code, test, and debug simple algorithms using programming languages such as Python or Java.</li><li>Foster an understanding of the ethical and social responsibilities of engineers and their role in sustainable development and environmental protection.</li><li>Appreciate the relevance of physics in various fields, such as technology, engineering, and medicine.</li><li>Display proper techniques for preparing and handling laboratory chemicals, including safety methods and hazard precautions.</li><li>Identify and manipulate algebraic expressions, including equations, inequalities, and functions, using appropriate rules of algebra.</li><li>Understand the relationship between physical structure and physiological function at the cellular and systemic levels.</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals">Writing Effective Learning Goals</a><a id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Learning goals are at a larger scale than learning objectives, describing broad outcomes at the course-level.</p><p>An instructor may have only five or so learning goals for an entire course. Because a goal is not directly measured by a single assessment question, it can use terms such as understand and appreciate, which should be avoided for learning objectives.</p><p>To write an effective learning goal, we suggest the following:</p><ul><li>Think about the larger purpose or aims of the course you are designing. What do you want students to be able to do with the knowledge they gain in this course?</li><li>Goals can be ambitious and even philosophical–they communicate that &quot;big picture&quot; feeling to the students.</li><li>It might be helpful to think about what you would want your students to remember or understand about the course 5 years from now.</li><li>Write the goal in broad terms but with enough specificity to provide purpose and direction for instructional design.</li></ul><p>Examples:</p><ol><li>Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.</li><li>Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.</li><li>Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.</li></ol><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Give Advice for Learning Goals</h4><p>The following learning goals come from Professor Nguyen&#39;s earth science course.</p><ol><li>Students will explain the causes and effects of plate tectonics and how this process has shaped the surface of the Earth over millions of years.</li><li>Students will explore the structure and composition of the Earth&#39;s interior and the relationship between geologic features such as mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes.</li><li>Students will understand Earth&#39;s natural systems.</li></ol><p>Write feedback you would give to Professor Nguyen if they were your peer, such as:</p><ul><li>Areas that are too specific or too broad.</li><li>If a statement is a learning objective, not a goal.</li><li>Modifications to make the statement into a more effective learning goal.</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Objectives"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Objectives">Writing Effective Learning Objectives</a><a id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Objectives-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Objectives" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Learning objectives are at a smaller grain size than learning goals and describe specific outcomes at the topic level.</p><!-- `TODO I think we need to clarify here that the step is NOT to just come up with 2 to 5 things at random, but to (1) come up with a RICH understanding of the objective and imagine ALL the ways learners might demonstrate that, bring their background knowledge to it, etc. (2) and THEN whittle that down to 2 to 5 objectives that SPAN that full understanding of the goal.` --><p>A general suggestion is to have two to five learning objectives per topic, depending on its complexity.

Use concrete, observable terms that can be assessed through a variety of methods, such as tests, projects, or essays.</li><li><strong>Be realistic:</strong> The objective should be achievable within the context of the course unit and based on a reasonable level of prior knowledge or skill.</li><li><strong>Align with learning goals:</strong> The objective should align with a larger learning goal.</li></ul><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Align Goals and Objectives</h4><p>For each learning objective below, describe how it aligns with one or more specific learning goals further below:</p><p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><ol><li>Predict how changes to the natural water cycle process from human activities affect other lifeforms on Earth.</li><li>Explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.</li><li>Evaluate the effects of droughts, floods, and water pollution on various civilizations around the globe.</li><li>Describe the water cycle and its different stages, including precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, surface runoff, and groundwater storages.</li><li>Analyze the human impact on the water cycle, including deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.</li></ol><p><strong>Goals:</strong></p><ol><li>Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.</li><li>Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.</li><li>Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.</li></ol></div></div><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Raising Learning Objective Bloom Levels</h4><p>Professor Kim realizes that many of the learning objectives for his botany course are at the Remember level of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy (Level 1).</p><p>To ensure that his students go beyond mere memorization and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, Professor Kim needs to articulate learning objectives for higher order skills.</p><p>One objective he needs to reword is:</p><blockquote><p>Label the parts of a plant cell and recall their functions, including the cell wall, nucleus, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.</p></blockquote><p>Help Professor Kim by rewriting this objective into two new learning objectives at two different Bloom&#39;s levels above Level 1.</p><p>You can use this list of action verbs to help reword the objective:</p><ol><li><strong>Remember:</strong> define, duplicate, identify, list, memorize, name, recall, recognize, repeat, state</li><li><strong>Comprehend:</strong> classify, describe, discuss, explain, locate, paraphrase, report, select, summarize, translate</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> choose, demonstrate, dramatize, draw, employ, execute, illustrate, implement, interpret, operate, perform, sketch, solve, use</li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> compare, contrast, deconstruct, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, infer, investigate, organize, predict, question, test</li><li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> appraise, argue, assess, criticize, critique, defend, judge, justify, prioritize, support, value</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> assemble, build, compose, construct, design, develop, devise, formulate, invent, plan, produce, write</li></ol></div></div><h3 id="Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments">Determine acceptable evidence and align objectives with assessments</a><a id="Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Once you have learning objectives that are aligned to learning goals, the next step is to design assessments that are aligned to the learning objectives.</p><p>Why is this such a critical step?

Some options might be:</p><ul><li>Students construct a diagram that shows each stage of the water cycle.

Students then discuss how much water is absorbed from the simulated precipitation and simulated runoff.</li><li>Students compare and contrast how the water cycle varies depending on the climate, such as a tropical rainforest versus a desert.</li></ul><p>As before, activities should be aligned to the Bloom&#39;s level of the assessment questions. In this example, the learning objective, assessment, and activity are all at a lower-order cognitive level. If an instructor wishes to include assessments at a higher-order level, then additional activities must be designed to help progress students to that level.</p><p>Ideally, multiple activities are leveraged to help students get more practice, gain expertise toward higher-order skills, and engage a diversity of students in learning.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Align Objectives and Assessments: Part Two</h4><p>Professor Gupta has the following assessment question in their astronomy class:</p><blockquote><p>Astronomers have discovered a new star and have been collecting data on it such as its size, temperature, and luminosity.

    #### Plan Your Goals, Objectives, and Assessments

    ```@raw html
    <!-- `TODO see comment above, I think we need to draw out that they should think about all the complexity of how a goal can be demonstrated, what background students bring to it, etc.` ->
    ```

    *Answer in your workbook:*

    1. Reflect on and write your course goals. What is the purpose of this course? What big questions will it answer? What big problems will it aim to solve? What ways of thinking will it elucidate?
    2. Based on these course-level learning goals, think about how your course is broken up into units and identify the topics within each unit.
    3. Next, develop learning objectives that address each unit's topic. These are measurable and specific objectives that will inform you and your students on how well they learned the course content.
    4. Write out the learning objectives for each day of class. What will students learn? What will they be able to do? How do these objectives fit together within a unit?
    5. Plan your assessments. How will students demonstrate whether the objectives are achieved?
    6. Plan your activities. What activities will help students achieve the objectives? How will they practice their skills, learn knowledge, and gauge progress toward the learning objectives?

    ```@raw html
    <!-- `TODO reinforce UDL concepts in question 5 above` ->

    Until you've completed the learning experiences module, you may wish to keep the assessments and activities as simple ideas, then build on them later.
