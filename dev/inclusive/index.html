In the opening activity, we saw how an email can communicate what the course will look like and forecast details about the instructor.

--><p>Before the semester even starts, a student may feel intimidated or start doubting their ability to succeed. All students have the right to an education and should be given the tools and space to engage and learn. What can we do as educators to help all students succeed?</p><p>One of the first steps we can take is to be intentional in the ways we set up our course. In particular, we can influence the course climate–the overall learning environment in a classroom or educational setting–to be more inclusive (Dewsbury &amp; Brame, 2019). An inclusive course climate is one where all students feel welcome, valued, and supported regardless of different backgrounds and identities (Brame. 2019).</p><h3 id="Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?">Hot or Cold or Just Right?</a><a id="Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Because course climate is a somewhat abstract concept, we will use an analogy to help us understand it more deeply: temperature.</p><p>A common phrase associated with group spaces is &quot;taking the temperature of a room,&quot; which means assessing and gauging the emotional or social atmosphere of a situation or group of people. It involves observing the general mood, attitudes, and reactions of individuals in a group to determine how they are feeling and what their overall response is to a situation or idea.</p><ul><li>🔥 <strong>Hot:</strong> The atmosphere is charged, tense, or hostile. It could also indicate that the individuals in the room are passionate or enthusiastic about a particular topic or idea, which can make others feel anxious or apprehensive about engaging. Students may engage in dismissive, disruptive, or disrespectful behaviors. The classroom environment may be overtly hostile to students based on race, gender, socioeconomic or other status, ability, or other demographic factors.</li><li>🧊 <strong>Cold:</strong> The atmosphere is unfavorable, unfriendly, or unwelcoming. The individuals in the room may be unresponsive or uninterested in the topic or discussion being presented. Students may withdraw from participating in activities or attending class altogether. The classroom environment may be covertly hostile to students based on race, gender, socioeconomic or other status, ability, or other demographic factors.</li><li>⚖️ <strong>Just Right:</strong> The atmosphere is collaborative, collegial, and supportive. It suggests that the individuals in the room are receptive and engaged, and conversations are respectful and inquiry-based. Diverse perspectives are encouraged and considered. This type of room temperature correlates with a respectful buzz of engagement, where everyone feels their voice is heard, their insights are valid, and their questions are welcome.</li></ul><!-- `TODO where's the data on how well (or not well) we can accurately gauge these things in a real setting? across cultures? etc.?` --><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Reflect on Course Temperatures</h4><p>Recall times when your courses – when you were a student – felt &quot;Hot,&quot; &quot;Cold,&quot; or &quot;Just Right.&quot; Try to describe a few examples of each.</p><p>Then reflect:</p><ul><li>What all do you think contributed to making those courses feel that way?</li><li>How did it impact your learning experiences in that course?</li><li>Did any course have a mix of &quot;Hot,&quot; &quot;Cold,&quot; or &quot;Just Right&quot; days?</li><li>Did any course feel at times &quot;Just Right&quot; to you, but &quot;Hot&quot; or &quot;Cold&quot; to your peers?</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="Instructor-Immediacy-and-Presence"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Instructor-Immediacy-and-Presence">Instructor Immediacy and Presence</a><a id="Instructor-Immediacy-and-Presence-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Instructor-Immediacy-and-Presence" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><strong>Instructor immediacy</strong> is &quot;the extent to which communication behaviors enhance closeness to and nonverbal interaction with another&quot; (Mehrabian. 1969, p. 203) as well as behaviors that reduce distance between teacher and student (Andersen, 1979).</p><p><strong>Instructor presence</strong> is the degree to which instructors are actively involved in the learning environment, including how the course is designed, organized, and managed as well as how the learning is facilitated (Garrison et al., 1999).</p><p>Research has shown many positive outcomes from engaging in instructor immediacy and presence practices:</p><ul><li>There is a significant relationship between instructor immediacy and student affective and cognitive learning (Andersen et al., 1981).</li><li>When instructors exhibit behaviors related to instructor presence, students report high levels of learning and community (Shea et al., 2006).</li><li>Student affective learning, cognition, and motivation are significantly and positively correlated to instructor immediacy and presence (Baker, 2010).</li></ul><p>Examples of instructor immediacy (Andersen et al., 1981) and presence (Arbaugh &amp; Hwang. 2006) include:</p><ul><li>Instructor Immediacy:<ul><li>Maintain closer physical distance</li><li>Use direct body orientation</li><li>Use eye contact</li><li>Engage in positive body movements such as nods and smiles</li></ul></li><li>Instructor Presence:<ul><li>Communicate goals</li><li>Set guidelines for student interaction</li><li>Encourage student participation</li><li>Ensure students don&#39;t feel isolated</li></ul></li></ul><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Instructor Immediacy and Presence</h4><p>Match each of the following interactions to either &quot;Instructor Immediacy&quot; or &quot;Instructor Presence.&quot;</p><ul><li>Addressing students by their preferred names</li><li>Providing clear instructions and guidance for course assignments</li><li>Participating actively in discussion forums and online chats</li><li>Expressing nonverbal cues to show interest and attention</li><li>Making regular announcements and updates to the course content</li><li>Using humor during lectures or in interactions with students</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="Identity-and-Course-Climate"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Identity-and-Course-Climate">Identity and Course Climate</a><a id="Identity-and-Course-Climate-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Identity-and-Course-Climate" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><strong>Social identity</strong> is defined as the sense of self that comes from membership in a social group (or groups) along with the &quot;value and emotional significance attached to that membership&quot; (Tajfel, 1981. p. 255).

Instructors who choose to share their social and/or professional identities send a message to students that it is also okay for them to share their identities in the classroom, be their authentic self, and bring all of who they are to their work.</p><p>Further, the identities that an instructor presents or that are perceived by students impact students&#39; motivation, engagement, and sense of belonging.</p><p>For example, instructors who are approachable, open-minded, and understanding can create a safe space where students feel comfortable expressing their opinions and asserting themselves. Instructors who openly value and bring diversity, inclusion, and cultural awareness into their teaching demonstrate to students that diversity is respected and encouraged.</p><p>Through sharing and thoughtful integration of one&#39;s identities into the course, instructors can cultivate positive relationships with their students, leading to enhanced learning outcomes, a sense of belonging, and persistence in STEM (Estrada et al., 2011).</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Reflect on Identity in Teaching Contexts</h4><p><em>Answer in your workbook:</em></p><p>Take a few minutes to reflect on your various social and professional identities.

Practicing antiracism requires constantly identifying, challenging, and replacing existing racist acts and policies to foster equity between racial groups.</p><p><strong>Justice:</strong> A concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society. It involves ensuring that power, wealth, education, healthcare, and other opportunities are distributed fairly among individuals regardless of their background. It also means treating people of all races fairly, so that everyone has the same chances and outcomes. Achieving racial justice requires putting systems and measures in place that actively work towards equal treatment and opportunities for people of all races.</p><p><strong>Equity:</strong> The condition in which individuals are provided the resources they need to have access to the same opportunities as the general population. Equity accounts for systematic inequalities, meaning the distribution of resources provides more for those who need them most.</p><p><strong>Diversity:</strong> The myriad of ways in which people differ, including the psychological, physical, cognitive, and social differences that occur among all individuals, such as race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, religion, education, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, mental and physical ability, immigration status, and learning preferences. Diversity is all-inclusive and supportive of the proposition that everyone and every group should be valued.</p><p><strong>Inclusion:</strong> Authentically bringing traditionally excluded individuals or groups into processes, activities, and decision- and policy-making in a manner that shares power.</p><p>(<a href="../refs/#lawrence2004structural">Lawrence and Keleher, 2004</a>; <a href="../refs/#miller_ajedi_2022">Miller <em>et al.</em>, 2022</a>)</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../intro/">« Scientific Teaching</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../design/">Course Design »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">© 2024 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.7.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Friday 6 September 2024 22:24">Friday 6 September 2024</span>.
