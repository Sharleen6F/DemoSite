- **Antiracism:** Active efforts to reduce racism that are embodied in behaviors, actions, and policies that lead to racial equity and are substantiated by antiracist ideas. Practicing antiracism requires constantly identifying, challenging, and replacing existing racist acts and policies to foster equity between racial groups.

- Course design
- **Equity:** The condition in which individuals are provided the resources they need to have access to the same opportunities as the general population. Equity accounts for systematic inequalities, meaning the distribution of resources provides more for those who need them most.

- **Diversity:** The myriad of ways in which people differ, including the psychological, physical, cognitive, and social differences that occur among all individuals, such as race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, religion, education, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, mental and physical ability, immigration status, and learning preferences. Diversity is all-inclusive and supportive of the proposition that everyone and every group should be valued.

Achieving racial justice requires putting systems and measures in place that actively work towards equal treatment and opportunities for people of all races.
