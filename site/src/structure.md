## Course Structure Defined

!!! compat ""
    `NOTE: This content was restructured recently. Its objectives need to be rewritten.`

Course structure refers to the organizational system of a course, including schedule, format, content, communication modes and overall themes. A well-structured course communicates all of these components to students and ensures they have access to each component.

How the course is structured can contribute to making the course inclusive for diverse students. As we structure our courses and plan out the details of our course design, it is also important to consider how we communicate our course design with students in our syllabus and our course can be inclusive and accessible for all students.

        Dear students,

        It is my pleasure to welcome you to BIO 101 - Introduction to Biology. My name is Mei Wong, and I will be your instructor for this course. Biology is an exciting and ever-evolving field that explores the diversity of life, the processes that sustain life, and the interactions between living organisms and their environments. Throughout this course, we will cover the fundamentals of biology, including cell biology, genetics, ecology, and evolution. Based on your interests, we will also discuss current issues and challenges facing the field of biology, such as climate change and emerging diseases. 

        As a student in BIO 101, you will be part of a diverse and engaging community of learners. You will have the opportunity to work with your peers on group projects, participate in classroom discussions, and engage in case studies.

        To get started, please review the course syllabus and familiarize yourself with the expectations and requirements for the course. It is okay if the last biology course you took was many years ago. We will work together to elicit your prior knowledge and leverage the skills and experiences you have to help you succeed in the course. My goal is to provide a classroom space where you are free to take chances, make mistakes, and learn from each other.

        There is no textbook to purchase, but you will need access to a computer and the internet to read pre-class readings and submit assignments on Canvas (our learning management system). Please email me or speak to me if you have concerns or issues related to access.

        If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am available to meet with you during office hours or by appointment to discuss any course-related topics or questions you may have. My door is also always open if you need guidance or someone to speak to about non-course topics.

        I look forward to meeting you and working with you throughout the semester. Let's make it a great one!

        Best regards,

## A Framework for Course Structure

The structure of a course and organization of its content, activities, experiences, and assessments lie on a continuum from low to high. Low structure courses have few opportunities for engagement and assessment whereas high structure courses embed multiple opportunities for engagement and frequent assessments (Beck & Roosa, 2020). Low structure courses assume that students know how to efficiently work with course materials in and outside of class. However, data suggest that many students do not implement effective study strategies nor time management skills (Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012). High structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice and by decoding the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations (Beck & Roosa, 2020).

    Which course looks more like yours and why?

    If you haven't taught a course yet, which course preparation resonates with your experiences as a student?
  

### The Impact of High Structure Courses

Increasing a course's structure has many implications for student learning and their educational experience.

- **Student failure rates** were lower in a moderately structured course design and were **dramatically lower in a highly structured course design** (Freeman et al., 2011)
- A "moderate-structure" intervention **increased course performance for all student populations**, but worked **disproportionately well for black students and first-generation students**. Students also consistently reported completing the assigned readings more frequently, spending more time studying for class, and feeling an increased sense of community (Eddy & Hogan, 2014)
- Implementing a hybrid course format with high structure improved exam performance for **traditionally underrepresented students** (Gavassa et al., 2019)
- A highly structured course design improved the performance of all students in a college-level introductory biology class and **reduced the achievement gap between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged students** (Haak et al., 2011)

### Show Me the Data!

Freeman and colleagues measured failure rates in a major's introductory biology course, while varying the structure of the course. One instructor taught the course in $6$ iterations using a low structure, moderate structure, or high structure course design (2011). The researchers found that the difference between the proportion of students predicted to fail and the actual proportion failing decreased with increasing structure. ($n = 2267$, $*p = 0.06$, $**p = 0.0004$).

!!! note "" 
    #### Evaluate the Data Yourself

    Eddy and Hogan (2014) used a similar study structure, comparing exam performance in traditional vs. increased structure sections of the same course. The figure below shows point estimates for exam performance (% correct) based on a regression model that included (A) race and ethnicity and (B) first-generation status.

    What conclusions can you draw from these data? (Check all that apply.)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs44.png)

    - Exam performance will likely not be affected by course structure.
    - All students are expected to perform worse on exams in high structure courses.
    - All students are expected to perform better on exams in high structure courses.
    - Students from communities historically excluded from STEM aren't expected to show much improvement.
    - Students from communities historically excluded from STEM are expected to show greater improvements.

Remember, a high structure course has multiple opportunities for engagement and practice and makes clear the learning goals and expectations (Beck & Roosa, 2020). Eddy and Hogan provide a table that shows how adding in more graded preparatory assignments, student in-class engagement, and graded review assignments increases course design (2014).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs45.png)

Preparatory assignments are tasks or activities given to students prior to a class or lesson to help them prepare for upcoming content. Examples: reading assigned texts, watching videos, researching a topic, completing practice exercises.

Graded review assignments are tasks or assessments that evaluate students' understanding, comprehension, and recall of previously covered material. Examples: case studies, writing assignments, discussion posts, quizzes, projects.

    #### Increasing the Course Structure

    Professor Ali wants to transform her lecture-based chemistry course into a higher structure course, but is feeling overwhelmed. What are some possible small changes Professor Ali can make to her Week 1 course map to modify it from a low structure to a moderate structure? (Select all that apply.)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs46.png)

    - Add a homework assignment that covers concepts from class such as entropy.
    - Add a brief pre-class quiz on principles of energy conservation.
    - Have students complete example problems in class and use small group discussions.
    - Add in a few clicker questions that elicit students' prior knowledge on the week's concepts.

### Learner-Centered Syllabi

The syllabus offers one of the first opportunities for instructors to communicate with their students about the course and begin building an inclusive learning environment. The **conventional syllabus** is *content-focused*, providing a brief overview of the course subject matter followed by a weekly outline of topics to be covered, and a list of assignments and course activities with relative grading weights and due dates.

A **learner-centered syllabus** also provides basic course information, but **it shifts the emphasis** from what the instructor will cover in the course *to what learning outcomes students will achieve by the end of the course* (Johnson, 2006). It explains how learning will be assessed and offers information and tools to promote student learning and intellectual development in an inclusive environment. It establishes the responsibilities of the instructor(s) and students for achieving course goals. In short, the learner-centered syllabus "becomes an invitation to share responsibility for successful learning" (O'Brien et al., 2008, p. 22).

In his book, "What the Best College Teachers Do," Ken Bain (2004) describes three parts of what he calls "the promising syllabus":

1. **Highlight the promises or opportunities.**
    - What kinds of questions will the course help students answer?
    - What kind of intellectual, physical, emotional, or social abilities will it help them develop?
    - Why is the course relevant?
2. **Explain what students will do to meet those promises.**
    - What are the learning activities (e.g., activities, assignments, readings) that will be used in the course?
    - How will they learn from the course resources, the instructional team, and each other?
    - Give students a sense of agency in their education
3. **Discuss how students will engage in the learning process.**
    - How will the instructor and students best "understand the nature and progress of their learning?"
    - How will learning be evaluated?
    - How will all students feel included in the learning process and welcome as scientists?

    #### Learner-Centered Syllabus

    !!! details "Click to see an example excerpt of a learner-centered syllabus"
        The following is excerpted from Dr. Cara Gormally's asynchronous introductory biology class for non-majors (bilingual-American Sign Language & English).

        **What we'll actually do**

        - You're likely taking this class because it's required for your major.
        - My goal: make this class actually useful to your life.
        - Together, we'll make this class meaningful for ourselves. How will we do that?
        - We'll learn biology relevant to our lives: when a person is most likely to get pregnant; how Covid-19 vaccines work; why we have skin color; how antidepressants work; what we can do to slow climate change; and why we should limit plastic use.
        - There's no textbook; we'll read and watch high quality enjoyable articles and videos.
        - We'll learn how to answer questions we have related to biology, for example about health or the environment.
        - I hope you're excited about our class--I am so excited to get to know you all and do this work together! This work feels real and important to me. I hope you think so, too.

        **Diversity: it makes our class better**

        - **Build community through discussion:** Though we won't meet face-to-face, we'll learn about each other and build a community through our discussions.
        - **Diversity strengthens us:** The diversity that we all bring to this class is a resource, strength and benefit to our class. I'm committed to anti-racism and I believe Black Lives Matter. Everyone belongs here in my classroom if you want to be here. In this class, we'll use materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, national origin, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
        - **You make our class what it is.** Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective--it's important.

    Now that you've seen a learner-centered syllabus, reflect on your own syllabus. (If you do not have one, think about a traditional syllabus or one from a course you've taken.) Think about the elements in a learner-centered syllabus and the components of your syllabus.

    What are two things you could change in your syllabus to make it more learner-centered? You can use these prompts to help you re-imagine your syllabus:
    - What are the promises or opportunities presented by the instructor?
    - What activities will students do in order to meet those promises?
    - How will students track progress of their learning (i.e., how will learning be evaluated)?
