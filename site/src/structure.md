## Course Structure Defined

<u>What is course structure?</u> 

The organizational structure of a course, including schedule, format, communication modes and overall themes. A well-structured course communicates all of these components to students, and ensures they have access to each component.

    Dear students,

    It is my pleasure to welcome you to BIO 101 - Introduction to Biology. My name is Mei Wong, and I will be your instructor for this course. Biology is an exciting and ever-evolving field that explores the diversity of life, the processes that sustain life, and the interactions between living organisms and their environments. Throughout this course, we will cover the fundamentals of biology, including cell biology, genetics, ecology, and evolution. Based on your interests, we will also discuss current issues and challenges facing the field of biology, such as climate change and emerging diseases. 

    As a student in BIO 101, you will be part of a diverse and engaging community of learners. You will have the opportunity to work with your peers on group projects, participate in classroom discussions, and engage in case studies.

    To get started, please review the course syllabus and familiarize yourself with the expectations and requirements for the course. It is okay if the last biology course you took was many years ago. We will work together to elicit your prior knowledge and leverage the skills and experiences you have to help you succeed in the course. My goal is to provide a classroom space where you are free to take chances, make mistakes, and learn from each other.

    There is no textbook to purchase, but you will need access to a computer and the internet to read pre-class readings and submit assignments on Canvas (our learning management system). Please email me or speak to me if you have concerns or issues related to access.

    If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am available to meet with you during office hours or by appointment to discuss any course-related topics or questions you may have. My door is also always open if you need guidance or someone to speak to about non-course topics.

    I look forward to meeting you and working with you throughout the semester. Let's make it a great one!

    Best regards,

    **Mei Wong, Ph.D.** (she/her, they/them)

    Dear students,

    I am writing to welcome you to BIO 101 - Introduction to Biology. My name is Emilio Reyes, and I will be your instructor for this course.
    Biology is a complex and fascinating field that requires a disciplined and rigorous approach to learning. Throughout this course, we will
    cover the fundamental concepts of biology, including cell biology, genetics, ecology, and evolution.

    As a student in this course, you will be held to a high standard of academic excellence. You will be expected to attend all class meetings,
    arrive on time, and actively participate in discussions. You must complete all assigned readings and assignments on time and meet all
    deadlines.

    It is essential that you come to this course prepared to learn, work hard, and meet the expectations set forth in the course syllabus.Failure to do so may result in a lower grade or even failure of the course.

    If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. However, please understand that I expect you to take responsibility for your own learning and to do everything in your power to succeed in this course.

    I look forward to working with you throughout the semester and seeing you meet the expectations of this challenging course.

    Sincerely,

    **Emilio Reyes, Ph.D.**

## A Framework for Course Structure 

By adopting the principles of Universal Design, an instructor can build an inclusive course from the outset.

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** is a *framework for designing and delivering flexible, inclusive, and accessible learning experiences that can be customized to meet the needs of all learners*, regardless of their abilities, backgrounds, or learning preferences (CAST, 2018). It is rooted in the principles of **Universal Design**, which is an approach to creating products environments, and experiences that are **usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design**. UDL is based on the idea that learning should be engaging, relevant, and responsive to individual needs. Importantly, **UDL aims to change thedesign of the environment rather than to change the learner.**

As we saw previously, **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** *places accessibility at the forefront and leverages various AJEDI principles* for improving teaching and learning for all students. To help implement UDL in the classroom, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) developed the **UDL Guidelines** (CAST, 2018). These are *a set of principles and strategies that aim to provide equal and inclusive access to learning for all students*, including those with disabilities or diverse learning styles. The guidelines provide specific recommendations for creating flexible and engaging learning environments and materials that can be customized to meet the diverse needs and preferences of all students.
