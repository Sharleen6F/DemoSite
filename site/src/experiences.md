# Learning Experiences

## Module Goals

In this module, we hope you will...

- Define learning experiences and its goals.
- Explain how learning experiences engage students in learning the facets of science.
- Examine why learning experiences matters for diversity.
- Begin applying learning experiences to your own teaching and course(s).

## Learning Experiences Defined

!!! compat "Objectives"
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    - Define what learning experiences encompass.
    - Write your own definition of active learning and compare it to other published definitions.
    - Describe how active learning and formative assessment converge.
    - Compare and contrast active learning and student-centered learning
    - Understand key concepts and principles:
        - Learning experiences refers to all in- and out-of-class activities that cognitively engage students with the course content and skills in an inclusive manner.
        - While there is no single, consistent definition, active learning involves students engaging in activities that promote cognitive engagement.
        - Learning experiences should be student-centered, provide feedback, and allow for real-time adjustments.

**Learning experiences** encompass all the opportunities students have to engage in learning science plus the factors that influence those opportunities. They leverage what we know about how learning works to appropriately scaffold learning.

Learning experiences manifest curricular intentions and bring science to life. They feature all the activities—active learning plus assessment opportunities—that occur during a course, plus the inclusive learning considerations that support them: from assignments to assessments, experiments to exams, interactions to inquiries, questions to quizzes. They include activities during a prescribed classroom period (such as a lecture or lab/field) and outside the classroom (such as a pre-class reading/quiz in a learning management system or a post-class homework assignment).

In the previous modules, we discussed how to account for our identities and our students’ prior knowledge, leverage the learning sciences, create a scientific curriculum with summative assessments, and design a climate that fosters learning. This module is where the action happens and the science comes to life!

We will build on the frameworks you saw previously (the 6 facets of science, the 5 dimensions of teaching, and the 5 steps in learning), by adding some new pedagogical tools: active learning strategies, formative assessment techniques, and inclusive learning approaches.

In short: Learning experiences manifest curricular intentions and bring science to life. **Learning experiences = active learning + assessment + inclusive learning**

### Active Learning Defined

At their core, learning experiences involve active learning. However, given its long history, there is not a single, consistently used definition of active learning in education literature.

So, before we delve into the whys and hows of adopting an active learning approach, let’s start by developing your personal working definition of this concept: What does active learning mean to you?

!!! note "Activity"
    How do you define active learning? Write this down before revealing published examples below.

    !!! details "Click to show published examples"
        - “...instructional activities involving students in doing things and thinking about what they are doing.” (Bonwell & Eison, 1991)
        - “Active learning simply means getting involved with the information presented - really thinking about it (analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating) rather than just passively receiving it and memorizing it.” (King, 1993)
        - “Active learning implies that students are engaged in their own learning. Active teaching strategies have students do something other than take notes or follow directions, placing the responsibility for learning squarely on their shoulders. As they participate in activities that involve group learning, problem solving, or inquiry-based learning, students construct new knowledge and build new scientific skills.” (Handelsman et al., 2007) 
        - “Active learning engages students in the process of learning through activities and/or discussions in class, as opposed to passively listening to an expert.” (Freeman et al. 2014)

    How were the published definitions similar to or different from your definition?
    
    Were the differences surprising or enlightening?
    
    Rethink your working definition of active learning to include any new insights or nuances that you have gained.

### Active learning + assessment

One goal of the previous reflection activity was to highlight that while active learning is a broad concept that encompasses a variety of techniques, a common feature of any definition is that students are cognitively engaged in something. “It may be quietly thinking, discussing an idea in a group, conducting an experiment, solving a problem, or writing a question or idea.” (Handelsman et al., 2007). The key is to engage students so that they are constructing knowledge.

This engagement highlights where active learning converges with assessment. The act of performing a task provides feedback to the individual, enabling them to gauge their progress and adjust their approach accordingly.

For example, when asked to interpret a graph as part of a learning activity, students reveal to themselves and their instructors their ability to extract and analyze information, allowing students to make real-time adjustments. Likewise, “assessment is automatically active because the students must do something to assess themselves or be assessed” (Handelsman et al., 2007).

As such, the relationship between active learning and assessment is nearly inseparable. This is particularly true for formative assessment which occurs during the learning cycle and enables continuous improvement through feedback.

### Formative Assessment Defined

Ongoing feedback is one of the most reliable ways to foster learning gains (Black & Wiliam, 1998). Formative assessment is defined as the suite of ongoing activities that enable students and instructors to monitor progress toward learning objectives, providing a mechanism for continuous improvement.

Formative assessment builds on active learning and connects directly to learning principles: as students apply new knowledge and practice new skills, they have the opportunity to think critically about their progress toward understanding and competency. In other words, formative assessment encourages students to think metacognitively.

Formative assessment provides a unique opportunity for feedback, which can take various forms. This may include self-assessment using a rubric, peer review with guidelines for constructive feedback, or instructor-led commentary. Importantly, formative assessment is not necessarily tied to grading, allowing students to focus on the process of learning rather than simply the outcome.

## Why Learning Experiences

!!! compat "Objectives"
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    - Describe the outcomes of studies comparing student learning in traditional vs. active learning classrooms.
    - Describe the four modes of student engagement (interactive, constructive, active, and passive strategies).
    - Understand key concepts and principles:
      - Active learning approaches lead to improved student learning and persistence, as well as increased learning gains and collaborative skills.
      - The more students are challenged to engage in high-level cognitive activities, the more they understand and improve.
