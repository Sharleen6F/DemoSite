# Learning Experiences

## Learning experiences, defined

!!! compat "Objectives"

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    - Define what learning experiences encompass.
    - Write your own definition of active learning and compare it to other published definitions.
    - Describe how active learning and formative assessment converge.
    - Compare and contrast active learning and student-centered learning
    - Understand key concepts and principles:
        - Learning experiences refers to all in- and out-of-class activities that cognitively engage students with the course content and skills in an inclusive manner.
      - While there is no single, consistent definition, active learning involves students engaging in activities that promote cognitive engagement.
      - Learning experiences should be student-centered, provide feedback, and allow for real-time adjustments.

**Learning experiences** encompass all the opportunities students have to engage in learning science plus the factors that influence those opportunities. They leverage what we know about how learning works to appropriately scaffold learning.

Learning experiences manifest curricular intentions and bring science to life. They feature all the activities—active learning plus assessment opportunities—that occur during a course, plus the inclusive learning considerations that support them: from assignments to assessments, experiments to exams, interactions to inquiries, questions to quizzes. They include activities during a prescribed classroom period (such as a lecture or lab/field) and outside the classroom (such as a pre-class reading/quiz in a learning management system or a post-class homework assignment).

In the previous modules, we discussed how to account for our identities and our students’ prior knowledge, leverage the learning sciences, create a scientific curriculum with summative assessments, and design a climate that fosters learning. This module is where the action happens and the science comes to life!

We will build on the frameworks you saw previously (the 6 facets of science, the 5 dimensions of teaching, and the 5 steps in learning), by adding some new pedagogical tools: active learning strategies, formative assessment techniques, and inclusive learning approaches.

In short: Learning experiences manifest curricular intentions and bring science to life.

**Learning experiences = active learning + assessment + inclusive learning**
