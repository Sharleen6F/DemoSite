## Learning Defined

Learning is the acquisition and integration of new information that leads to a change in behavior.

!!! note "Activity"

    Think of a concept that is challenging for students to learn. 

    - Why do you think it is challenging?
    - What may help or hinder student learning in your discipline?
    - In general, under what conditions do you learn best?
    - Does your personal view of learning affect how you teach?

---

## Why Learning

When we approach from the perspective of what students will learn rather than what we will teach… [TBD]

`TODO: finish this`

Move away from assumptions that students are lacking and move toward the idea that learning environments are lacking (in structure) and can be changed.

## A Framework for Learning

**Constructing Knowledge**

- Everyone has views about how the world works. Views are based on prior knowledge and experiences. The views could be inaccurate, insufficient, or inappropriate.

- New information challenges these views. Consistent information validates the views, while inconsistent information requires the difference to be reconciled and explained.

- During reconciliation, new neural networks form. [What else cognitively?]

- New neural networks [and cognitive psychology] lead to changes in behavior or affect.

- Repetition, extended application, targeted practice, and assessment with feedback contribute to retention. [Where does metacognition go?]

**Constructivism is…**

### Seven Principles for Learning

This brings us to a set of research-based principles that are important for learning (Ambrose et al., 2010). 
1. Prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.
3. Expertise requires skills, practice, and application.
4. Motivation determines, directs, and sustains what students do to learn.
5. Goal-directed practice + targeted feedback enhances the quality of learning.
6. Students’ level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate to impact learning.
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

### The Role of Prior Knowledge in Learning

Let’s start with prior knowledge. We often think of prior knowledge as “right” and “wrong.” We say that students either get it, or they don’t. This thinking leads us to assume that students hold misconceptions that need to be “corrected” or “replaced” with a right answer. We become frustrated when they get answers wrong that we lectured about or they read in the textbook.

However, prior knowledge is complex. Each student brings a set of knowledge, beliefs, experiences, and world views to every learning experience. In the 2010 book, How Learning Works: Seven research-based principles for smart teaching, Susan Ambrose et al., state: 
- Students connect what they learn to what they already know, interpreting incoming information, and even sensory perception, through the lens of their existing knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions (Vygotsky, 1978; NRC 2000)…. students must connect new knowledge to previous knowledge in order to learn (Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Resnick, 1983)…. However the extent to which students are able to draw on prior knowledge to effectively construct new knowledge depends on the nature of their prior knowledge, as well as the instructor’s ability to harness it. 

**Contending with prior knowledge**

*Activating prior knowledge:*

Prior knowledge must be activated for learning to occur. Ambrose et al., again:

- When students connect what they are learning to accurate and relevant prior knowledge, they learn and retain more. In essence, new knowledge “sticks” better when it has prior knowledge to stick to.

But students don’t always bring their knowledge or connect it to the learning experience at hand.


*Show me the evidence:*

People with more knowledge of soccer recalled more scores from different soccer matches than people with less soccer knowledge (Morris et al., 1981). 

When presented with new facts about individuals, college students were able to learn and retain those facts twice as often if the individuals were familiar when compared to unfamiliar individuals (Kole and Healy, 2007).

**Prior knowledge… that is not quite “right”**

What if the student’s prior knowledge is inaccurate, or their understanding is only partly correct? Understanding the types of prior knowledge can help us create better learning environments.

*Accurate but insufficient prior knowledge*

Students possess some relevant knowledge, but it is not sufficient to support subsequent learning or a desired level of performance. The knowledge can be declarative (facts and concepts) or procedural (knowing when or how to apply procedures, methods, or theories). 

>Example:
Students know which statistical test to perform (declarative) but cannot apply it (procedural). Students may be able to apply formulas to data analysis (procedural) but not be able to explain their logic (declarative).

*Inappropriate prior knowledge*

- Students draw on prior knowledge that is not appropriate for the learning context. It is not necessarily inaccurate – it is merely used inaccurately.

>Example:
 Students’ everyday associations with the terms positive and negative skew their understanding of science concepts, such as negative controls in an experiment, or negative reinforcement in psychology.

*Inaccurate prior knowledge*

Information that is objectively wrong. This includes incorrect facts, as well as flawed ideas, beliefs, models, or theories.

>Example:
Students believe that Pluto is a planet or that the heart oxygenates the blood.

    **Prior knowledge and misconceptions**

    How can we con tend with all these types of prior knowledge? Be clear in the knowledge requirements for different tasks. Do not assume because students know the facts that they know how to apply them, and vice versa. Assess both the amount and nature of prior knowledge and design instruction accordingly. 
    
    *Now you try!* Below is an example designed to elicit prior knowledge and misconceptions about antibiotic resistance and evolution. 

    **Student Activities:**

    >Part 1.

    View A Tiny World video (3 min 11 sec).
    Identify three misconceptions stated by the interviewees and explain what is wrong with them.

    >Part 2.

    Explain why each statement is incorrect.
    “I have a really bad cold.  I should go the doctor to get a prescription for antibiotics.”
    “Antibiotics are getting weaker.”
    “People are becoming immune to antibiotics.”
    “The bacteria mutated to become resistant to the antibiotic.”

    **Engagement prompts: Review the student activities.**

    - How do these activities activate prior knowledge?
    - What type of prior knowledge would these activities detect?
        - Accurate but insufficient - declarative
        - Accurate but insufficient - procedural
        - Inappropriate
        - Inaccurate
    - How would you characterize the statements in Part 2?
        - Accurate but insufficient - declarative
        - Accurate but insufficient - procedural
        - Inappropriate
        - Inaccurate
    - What would you teach next in this course?

**Research-based strategies for contending with prior knowledge**

Gauge the extent and nature of students’ prior knowledge:

- Administer diagnostic assessments
- Have students assess their own prior knowledge
- Use brainstorming to reveal prior knowledge
- Assign a concept map activity
- Look for patterns of error in student work
- Talk to a colleague

Activate accurate prior knowledge: 

- Use exercises to generate students’ prior knowledge (e.g., brainstorm, concept map)
- Explicitly link new material to knowledge from previous courses or your course
- Use analogies and examples that connect to everyday knowledge
- Ask students to reason on the basis of relevant prior knowledge
