# How Learning Works

## Module Goals

In this module, we hope you will...

- Define learning.
- Describe the seven principles of learning.
- Examine evidence-based strategies for eliciting and contending with prior knowledge.
- Apply learning sciences principles to your own teaching and course(s).

## Learning Defined

Learning is the acquisition and integration of new information that leads to a change in behavior.

!!! note "Activity"

    Think of a concept that is challenging for students to learn. 

    - Why do you think it is challenging?
    - What may help or hinder student learning in your discipline?
    - In general, under what conditions do you learn best?
    - Does your personal view of learning affect how you teach?

## Why Learning

When we approach from the perspective of what students will learn rather than what we will teach… [TBD]

`TODO: finish this`

Move away from assumptions that students are lacking and move toward the idea that learning environments are lacking (in structure) and can be changed.


## A Framework for Learning

**Constructing Knowledge**

- Everyone has views about how the world works. Views are based on prior knowledge and experiences. The views could be inaccurate, insufficient, or inappropriate.

- New information challenges these views. Consistent information validates the views, while inconsistent information requires the difference to be reconciled and explained.

- During reconciliation, new neural networks form. [What else cognitively?]

- New neural networks [and cognitive psychology] lead to changes in behavior or affect.

- Repetition, extended application, targeted practice, and assessment with feedback contribute to retention. [Where does metacognition go?]

**Constructivism is…**

### Seven Principles for Learning

This brings us to a set of research-based principles that are important for learning (Ambrose et al., 2010). 
1. Prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.
3. Expertise requires skills, practice, and application.
4. Motivation determines, directs, and sustains what students do to learn.
5. Goal-directed practice + targeted feedback enhances the quality of learning.
6. Students’ level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate to impact learning.
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

### The Role of Prior Knowledge in Learning

Let’s start with prior knowledge. We often think of prior knowledge as “right” and “wrong.” We say that students either get it, or they don’t. This thinking leads us to assume that students hold misconceptions that need to be “corrected” or “replaced” with a right answer. We become frustrated when they get answers wrong that we lectured about or they read in the textbook.

However, prior knowledge is complex. Each student brings a set of knowledge, beliefs, experiences, and world views to every learning experience. In the 2010 book, How Learning Works: Seven research-based principles for smart teaching, Susan Ambrose et al., state: 
- Students connect what they learn to what they already know, interpreting incoming information, and even sensory perception, through the lens of their existing knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions (Vygotsky, 1978; NRC 2000)…. students must connect new knowledge to previous knowledge in order to learn (Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Resnick, 1983)…. However the extent to which students are able to draw on prior knowledge to effectively construct new knowledge depends on the nature of their prior knowledge, as well as the instructor’s ability to harness it. 

**Contending with prior knowledge**

==*Activating prior knowledge:*==

Prior knowledge must be activated for learning to occur. Ambrose et al., again:

- When students connect what they are learning to accurate and relevant prior knowledge, they learn and retain more. In essence, new knowledge “sticks” better when it has prior knowledge to stick to.

But students don’t always bring their knowledge or connect it to the learning experience at hand.


==*Show me the evidence:*==

People with more knowledge of soccer recalled more scores from different soccer matches than people with less soccer knowledge (Morris et al., 1981). 

When presented with new facts about individuals, college students were able to learn and retain those facts twice as often if the individuals were familiar when compared to unfamiliar individuals (Kole and Healy, 2007).
